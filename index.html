         <p>I wouldn't necessarily say that being a full stack developer is more difficult than other roles -- I don't have to be a super genius to do it. I just need to be able to recognize, understand, prioritize and apply software patterns. It's something any motivated engineer can do.</p>

      <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
